# Races

## Racial Traits

The description of each race includes racial traits
that are common to members of that race. The
following entries appear among the traits of most
races.

### Ability Score Increase
Every race increases one or more of a character’s
ability scores.

### Age
The age entry notes the age when a member of the
race is considered an adult, as well as the race’s
expected lifespan. This information can help you
decide how old your character is at the start of the
game. You can choose any age for your character,
which could provide an explanation for some of your
ability scores. For example, if you play a young or
very old character, your age could explain a
particularly low Strength or Constitution score,
while advanced age could account for a high
Intelligence or Wisdom.

### Alignment
Most races have tendencies toward certain
alignments, described in this entry. These are not
binding for player characters, but considering why
your dwarf is chaotic, for example, in defiance of
lawful dwarf society can help you better define your
character.

### Size
Characters of most races are Medium, a size category
including creatures that are roughly 4 to 8 feet tall.
Members of a few races are Small (between 2 and 4
feet tall), which means that certain rules of the game
affect them differently. The most important of these
rules is that Small characters have trouble wielding
heavy weapons, as explained in "Equipment."

### Speed
Your speed determines how far you can move when
traveling ( "Adventuring") and fighting ("Combat").

### Languages
By virtue of your race, your character can speak,
read, and write certain languages.


# Dwarf

## Dwarf Traits

Your dwarf character has an assortment of inborn
abilities, part and parcel of dwarven nature.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Constitution score
increases by 2.

**Age.** Dwarves mature at the same rate as humans,
but they're considered young until they reach the
age of 50. On average, they live about 350 years.

**Alignment.** Most dwarves are lawful, believing
firmly in the benefits of a well-­‐‑ordered society. They
tend toward good as well, with a strong sense of fair
play and a belief that everyone deserves to share in
the benefits of a just order.

**Size.** Dwarves stand between 4 and 5 feet tall and
average about 150 pounds. Your size is Medium.

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 25 feet. Your
speed is not reduced by wearing heavy armor.

**Darkvision.** Accustomed to life underground, you
have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You
can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were
bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light.
You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of
gray.

**Dwarven Resilience.** You have advantage on
saving throws against poison, and you have
resistance against poison damage.

**Dwarven Combat Training.** You have proficiency
with the battleaxe, handaxe, light hammer, and
warhammer.

**Tool Proficiency.** You gain proficiency with the
artisan's tools of your choice: smith's tools, brewer's
supplies, or mason's tools.

**Stonecunning.** Whenever you make an
Intelligence (History) check related to the origin of
stonework, you are considered proficient in the
History skill and add double your proficiency bonus
to the check, instead of your normal proficiency
bonus.

**Languages.** You can speak, read, and write
Common and Dwarvish. Dwarvish is full of hard
consonants and guttural sounds, and those
characteristics spill over into whatever other
language a dwarf might speak.

### Hill Dwarf
As a hill dwarf, you have keen senses, deep intuition, 
and remarkable resilience.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Wisdom score 
increases by 1.

**Dwarven Toughness.** Your hit point maximum 
increases by 1, and it increases by 1 every time you 
gain a level.
